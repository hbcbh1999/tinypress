Github pages are simple static websites [and/or blogs] for you and your projects, freely hosted and published through Github.\r\n\r\nTinyPress features a clean, clutter-free interface to create a page (if you don't have one already), edit, delete and create new posts.\r\n\r\n## What information about me is accessed via my Github account?\r\nTinyPress requests access to your Github public repos to authenticate you, check if you have a Github page blog and pull your posts. If however you don't have a Github page, TinyPress will request access to your personal repo to be able to create your Github page.\r\n\r\n## What information is stored?\r\nTo make TinyPress work as is, your public Github profile details (username, name, email) and access to your public repo are stored. Posts are also cached (temporarily stored) during the active session. For more information about this, check out the privacy policy.\r\n\r\n## How much does it cost?\r\nTinyPress is completely FREE.\r\n\r\n## How do I get in touch?\r\nTwitter via [@tinypressco](http://twitter.com/tinypressco) or mail via miller.dain@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n## Who is behind this?\r\nMy name is Dain Miller. I build things for web and mobile. Follow me on twitter: @dainmiller or send me a mail: miller.dain@gmail.com.",
